Wikipedia Preview allows you to show a popup card with a short summary from Wikipedia when a reader clicks or hovers over a link

== Description ==
Wikipedia Preview brings free knowledge to your site in the form of a Wikipedia article preview popup. With Wikipedia Preview, a reader can see a short summary of an unknown word or concept in your content by hovering or tapping on the preview popup, without ever leaving your content page.
Wikipedia Preview is an official plugin developed and supported by the [Wikimedia Foundation.](https://wikimediafoundation.org/)

**Benefits**

* Leverage an enormous collection of free knowledge to provide context immediately when your readers are curious
* Enable users to stay on page/on site by giving them context while they read
* Available in over 300 languages, so you can provide, where available, context in a language different from your site
* No need to explain a concept that is not directly related to the article you are writing, add a contextual popup instead
* Use the same process you use today to add hyperlinks to your articles

**Features**

* Handles any link to a Wikipedia article regardless of language, lead image presence or length
* Works for Right-to-Left (RTL) and Left-To-Right (LTR) languages
* A built-in gallery to dive into article images.

**How to use**

After you [download and install](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#finding-and-installing-plugins) the Wikipedia Preview plugin, simply [add a link](https://wordpress.com/support/links/) in your site content to any Wikipedia article URL and it will be turned into a preview.
